# GOK

## Implementation Details

1. This app was written having `Kotlin` language as main language.
2. The architecture applied here was `Model-View-ViewModel` with `Data Binding`.
3. Since this app is small and contains only 2 screens, the use of `Dagger 2` library was considered unnecessary.
4. This app contains Instrumented Tests.
